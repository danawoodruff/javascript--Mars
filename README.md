WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! 
All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they
are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

Table dynamically created based upon a [provided dataset](static/js/data.js)- using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js.  The table can be filtered by one or more of the search criteria in the left hand navigation menu: <a href="https://danawoodruff.github.io/javascript-challenge/">View GitHub-Page</a><br>

The filters will clear and the page will refresh when the "Clear Filters" button is clicked.
